4. Run all cells

## 📊 Expected Results

### Performance Metrics (Approximate)
- **RMSE**: $8,000 - $12,000 (depending on model)
- **MAE**: $5,000 - $8,000
- **R² Score**: 0.80 - 0.90
- **Accuracy within 10%**: 70-85%

### Key Findings
- Ensemble model outperforms individual models
- Price predictions are most accurate for mid-range vehicles
- Year and mileage are strongest predictors
- Luxury brands show higher prediction variance

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**
   ```python
   # Ensure src is in path
   import sys
   sys.path.append('src')
   ```

2. **Missing Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost lightgbm catboost tensorflow shap
   ```

3. **Memory Issues**
   - Reduce dataset size for testing
   - Use smaller neural network architecture
   - Close other applications

4. **SHAP Errors**
   - SHAP may fail on some systems
   - Comment out explainability section if needed
   - Install specific SHAP version: `pip install shap==0.41.0`

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics Explained

### RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
- Measures average prediction error in dollars
- Lower values indicate better performance
- Sensitive to large errors

### MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- Average absolute prediction error
- Less sensitive to outliers than RMSE
- Easier to interpret

### R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)
- Measures proportion of variance explained
- Range: 0 to 1 (higher is better)
- 0.8+ indicates good model fit

### Prediction Accuracy within 10%
- Percentage of predictions within 10% of actual price
- Practical measure of real-world usefulness

## 🎯 Test Cases Included

The notebook tests predictions for:
- **Toyota Camry LE** (2020, 25K miles) - Reliable sedan
- **BMW X3 xDrive30i** (2022, 15K miles) - Luxury SUV
- **Ford F-150 XL** (2021, 35K miles) - Popular truck
- **Tesla Model 3** (2023, 5K miles) - Electric vehicle

## 📝 Customization

### Adding New Test Cases
```python
new_vehicle = {
    "make": "Honda",
    "model": "Civic",
    "year": 2021,
    "mileage": 20000,
    "cylinders": 4.0,
